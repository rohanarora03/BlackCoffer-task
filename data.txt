(the "Predecessor"),\n', b'an entity operating as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the United\n', b'States Bankruptcy Code since 1988. In August 1992, the Company completed a\n', b'public offering of 20,000,000 shares of its common stock. In May 1995, the\n', b'Company changed its name from Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc. to Sunbeam\n', b'Corporation.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'RESTRUCTURING AND GROWTH PLAN\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     In the Fall of 1996, under newly elected Chairman, Albert J.

The restructuring\n', b'portion of the plan was completed during 1997, resulting in a significant\n', b'reduction in employees, facilities and costs, all of which is anticipated to\n', b'generate approximately $225 million in annual savings for the Company. As a\n', b'part of the restructuring plan, the Company divested its non-core businesses\n', b'and assets, including furniture, time and temperature, decorative bedding, gas\n', b'heaters and logs, Counselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered\n', b"trademark/ scale businesses and the Company's Biddeford, Maine textile mill.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b"     The Company's restructuring plan included the closure of 18 factories, 43\n", b'warehouses and 5 headquarters, resulting in the consolidation of all corporate\n', b'offices into a single headquarters office located in Delray Beach, Florida and\n', b'an operations center at its Hattiesburg manufacturing and distribution\n', b'facility. The number of manufacturing facilities has been reduced from\n', b'twenty-six to eight (four in the US and four international). See "Properties"\n', b'below.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Company has also consolidated all purchasing functions, substantially\n', b'reduced the number of stock keeping units maintained by the Company and\n', b'outsourced certain administrative, manufacturing and distribution activities.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Company has developed a comprehensive three year growth plan for its\n', b"core businesses.

This revenue growth is anticipated to be derived, in large\n', b'part, by the development of new innovative products and the globalization of the\n', b'Company. Domestically, the goal is to introduce at least 30 new products each\n', b'year; during 1997, the Company introduced 35 new domestic products and 54 new\n', b'international products. In its international business, the Company has a goal to\n', b'triple international sales to $600 million by 1999. During 1997 the Company\n', b'entered into 25 new international distribution/license agreements.

The consolidation\n', b'trend in the retail industry has resulted in the emergence and global expansion\n', b'of large mass merchandisers that demand financially strong, efficient suppliers\n', b'which offer a broad range of innovative, quality products with the ability to\n', b'make timely shipments in large volumes and provide strong customer, promotional\n', b'and merchandising support. The Company has benefited from this trend and\n', b'believes it has the opportunity to further expand distribution with a number of\n', b'retailers and increase its penetration of existing\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                                       4\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'accounts. In 1997, the Company sold products to virtually all of the top 100\n', b'U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart, Price Costco, Kmart, Target Stores, Home\n', b"Depot, Sears, Roebuck & Co., Service Merchandise, Menards, Lowe's and J.C.\n", b'Penney.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     BRAND NAME RECOGNITION. The Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and\n', b'Oster/registered trademark/ brands have been household names for generations.\n', b'The Company believes that these brands, along with its other well-known\n', b'secondary names such as Mixmaster/registered trademark/ and\n', b'Osterizer/registered trademark/ draw customers into retail stores specifically\n', b'to purchase products bearing these brand names. During the past year, the\n', b'Company has spent over $56 million for advertising and sales promotion to\n', b'support brand recognition.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     MARKET LEADERSHIP. The majority of Sunbeam sales are from products in\n', b'which the Company holds the number one or two market share position. The\n', b'Company believes that this combination of leading brand-name products and\n', b'breadth of product offerings makes Sunbeam an attractive vendor to retailers\n', b'who are consolidating their suppliers.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'CUSTOMERS\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The rapid growth of large mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs and\n', b'changes in consumer shopping patterns have contributed to a significant\n', b'consolidation of the U.S. retail industry and the formation of dominant\n', b'multi-category retailers. Sunbeam has positioned itself to respond to the\n', b'challenges of this changing retail environment by pursuing strategic\n', b'relationships with large, high-volume merchandisers. The Company markets its\n', b'products through virtually every category of retailer including mass\n', b'merchandisers, catalog showrooms, warehouse clubs, department stores, hardware\n', b'stores, catalogues, television shopping channels, home centers, drug and\n', b'grocery stores, and pet supply retailers, as well as independent distributors\n', b"and the military post exchange services. The Company's largest customer,\n", b'Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 21% of sales in 1997.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Retailers are pursuing a number of strategies in their competition to\n', b'deliver the highest-quality, lowest-cost brand name products. A growing trend\n', b'among retailers is to purchase on a "just-in-time" basis in order to reduce\n', b'inventory costs and increase returns on investment. This trend has required\n', b'increased working capital investments for manufacturers and requires\n', b'manufacturers to more closely monitor consumer buying patterns as retailers\n', b'shorten their lead times for orders. Currently, most Sunbeam products sold to\n', b"U.S. retailers are manufactured at the Company's own facilities in North\n", b'America. However, one of the Company\'s goals for 1998 is to "source"\n', b'approximately fifty percent (50%) of parts and/or products from others,\n', b'including suppliers in Asia, in order to reduce capital investment in plants\n', b'while growing sales volume and to improve operating margins. The Company\n', b'intends to continue to support its retail partners\' "just-in-time" inventory\n', b'strategies through investments in, among other things, improved forecasting\n', b'systems, more responsive manufacturing and distribution capabilities and\n', b'electronic communications. Currently, Sunbeam has approximately 90% of its U.S.\n', b'customer sales on electronic data interchange (EDI) systems.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The amount of backlog orders at any point in time is not a significant\n', b"factor in the Company's business.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Sunbeam believes that an integral part of its strength is its ability to\n', b'capitalize on the Sunbeam/registered trademark/ and Oster/registered trademark/\n', b'trademarks which are registered in the United States and in numerous foreign\n', b'countries. Widely recognized throughout North America, South and Central\n', b'America and Europe, these registered trademarks, along with\n', b'Osterizer/registered trademark/, Mixmaster/registered trademark/, Toast\n', b'Logic/registered trademark/, Steammaster/registered trademark/,\n', b'Oskar/registered trademark/, Grillmaster/registered trademark/ and Blanket\n', b'with a Brain/registered trademark/ brands are important to the success of the\n', b"Company's products. Other important trademarks within Sunbeam include Oster\n", b'Designer/registered trademark/ line, Cuddle-Up/registered trademark/ and\n', b'A5/registered trademark/.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Sunbeam holds numerous patents covering a wide variety of products, the\n', b'loss of any one of which would not have a material adverse effect on the\n', b"Company's business taken as a whole.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'                                       5\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'EMPLOYEES\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Company currently has approximately 3,300 full-time domestic employees\n', b"and 4,200 international employees. None of the Company's domestic full-time\n", b'workforce has union representation. Sunbeam has had no material labor-related\n', b'work stoppages and, in the opinion of management, relations with its employees\n', b'are generally good.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'SEASONALITY\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     On a consolidated basis, Sunbeam sales do not exhibit substantial\n', b'seasonality. However, sales of outdoor cooking products are strongest in the\n', b'first half of the year, while sales of appliances and personal care and comfort\n', b'products are strongest in the second half of the year. In addition, sales of a\n', b"number of the Company's products, including warming blankets, vaporizers,\n", b'humidifiers and grills may be impacted by unseasonable weather conditions.\n', b'During 1997, the Company initiated early buy programs for highly seasonal\n', b'products such as grills and warming blankets in order to more levelize\n', b'production and distribution activities.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'RAW MATERIALS\n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     The raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products are\n", b'available from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to meet normal\n', b"requirements. The Company's primary raw materials include aluminum, steel,\n", b'resin, copper, and corrugated cardboard for cartons.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     The Company's operations, like those of comparable businesses, are subject\n", b'to certain federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations\n', b'in addition to laws and regulations regarding labeling and packaging of\n', b'products and the sale of products containing certain environmentally sensitive\n', b'materials ("Environmental Laws"). The Company believes it is in substantial\n', b'compliance with all Environmental Laws which are applicable to its operations.\n', b'Compliance with Environmental Laws involves certain continuing costs; however,\n', b'such costs of ongoing compliance have not resulted, and are not anticipated to\n', b"result, in a material increase in the Company's capital expenditures or to have\n", b"a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial\n", b'condition or competitive position.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     In addition to ongoing environmental compliance at its operations, the\n', b'Company also is actively engaged in certain environmental remediation\n', b'activities relating primarily to divested operations. As of December 31, 1997,\n', b'the Company had been identified by the United States Environmental Protection\n', b'Agency ("EPA") or a state environmental agency as a potentially responsible\n', b'party ("PRP") in connection with seven (7) sites subject to the federal\n', b'Superfund law and two (2) sites subject to state Superfund laws comparable to\n', b'the federal law (collectively the "Environmental Sites"), exclusive of sites at\n', b'which the Company has been designated (or expects to be designated) as a de\n', b'minimis (less than 1%) participant.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Superfund Act, and related state environmental remediation laws,\n', b'generally authorize governmental authorities to remediate a Superfund site and\n', b'to assess the costs against the PRPs or to order the PRPs to remediate the site\n', b'at their expense. Liability under the Superfund Law is joint and several and is\n', b'imposed on a strict basis, without regard to degree of negligence or\n', b'culpability. As a result, the Company recognizes its responsibility to\n', b'determine whether other PRPs at a Superfund site are financially capable of\n', b'paying their respective shares of the ultimate cost of remediation of the site.\n', b'Whenever the Company has determined that a particular PRP is not financially\n', b'responsible, it has assumed for purposes of establishing reserve amounts that\n', b'such PRP will not pay its respective share of the costs of remediation. To\n', b"minimize the Company's potential liability with respect to the Environmental\n", b'Sites, the Company has actively participated in steering committees and other\n', b'groups of PRPs established with respect to such sites. The Company currently is\n', b'engaged in active remediation activities at nine (9) sites, four (4) of which\n', b'are among the Environmental Sites referred to above, and five (5) of which have\n', b'not been designated as Superfund sites under federal or state law.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                                       6\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'     In addition, the Company is engaged in environmental remediation\n', b'activities at a site located in Newburgh Heights, Ohio, where a subsidiary\n', b'formerly conducted operations. The Company has been actively cooperating with\n', b'the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory\n', b'authorities in developing and implementing a plan for remediation of this site;\n', b'which remediation is anticipated to be substantially completed in 1998.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     The Company's costs for environmental remediation activities have not had\n", b"a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial\n", b'condition or competitive position. The Company has established reserves to\n', b'cover the anticipated probable costs of remediation, based upon periodic\n', b'reviews of all sites for which the Company has, or may have, remediation\n', b'responsibility. As of December 28, 1997, the amount of such reserves was\n', b"approximately four percent (4%) of the Company's total liabilities as set forth\n", b'in the consolidated financial statements. Such environmental reserves do not\n', b'anticipate any offsets for potential insurance recoveries from certain of the\n', b"Company's liability insurance carriers which the Company continues to pursue.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'     Due to uncertainty over the remedial measures to be adopted at some sites,\n', b'the possibility of changes in the Environmental Laws, and the fact that joint\n', b'and several liability with the right of contribution is possible at federal and\n', b"state Superfund sites, the Company's ultimate future liability with respect to\n", b'sites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the amounts\n', b'reserved at fiscal year end 1997. However, the Company believes, based on\n', b'existing information, that the costs of completing the environmental\n', b'remediation of all sites for which the Company has a remediation responsibility\n', b'have been adequately reserved and that the ultimate resolution of these matters\n', b"will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition.\n", b' \n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     In December 1996, the Company reached a negotiated settlement with the EPA\n', b'with regard to a notice of violation concerning the construction and operation\n', b"of two paint lines at the Company's Neosho, MO facility prior to obtaining the\n", b'necessary permits for construction and operation. The negotiated settlement\n', b'amount of $829,825 recognizes the benefits of a "supplemental environmental\n', b'project" which consisted of the Company\'s installation of nominal emission\n', b'powder coating lines to replace solvent paint lines. In October 1997, the\n', b'Company executed a Consent Decree documenting the settlement and is awaiting\n', b"the EPA's execution of the Consent Decree; the Company anticipates formal\n", b'resolution of this matter by the second quarter of 1998.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Company is not a party to any other administrative or judicial\n', b'proceeding to which a governmental authority is a party and which involves\n', b'potential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of $100,000 or\n', b'more.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     Certain of the information contained herein (including Management's\n", b'Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations)\n', b'contains "forward-looking" information, as that term is defined in the Private\n', b'Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as the same may be amended (herein the\n', b'"Act") and in releases made by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")\n', b'from time to time. Such "forward-looking" information may in included herein\n', b'under the following captions, among others: Item 1. Business--Restructuring and\n', b'Growth Plan, Pending Acquisitions, International, Competitive Strengths,\n', b"Customers, Raw Materials, Environmental Matters and Item 7--Management's\n", b'Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     These Cautionary Statements are being made pursuant to the Act, with the\n', b'intention of obtaining the benefits of the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Act.\n', b'The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements made by the\n', b'Company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may\n', b'differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of\n', b'various factors.\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company believes that it has sufficient management resources\n', b'to complete the pending acquisitions of Coleman, Signature Brands and First\n', b"Alert without negatively impacting on the Company's ongoing operations. In\n", b'addition, the Company expects to benefit from various operating synergies\n', b'arising from these acquisitions. If the Company fails to maintain its current\n', b'operations in the manner anticipated or fails to obtain the expected operating\n', b"synergies, such failures could negatively effect the Company's financial and/or\n", b'operating performance, which effect could be material.\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company expects to significantly increase the amount of its\n', b'outstanding indebtedness and to enter into financing arrangements which may\n', b'contain various restrictive covenants, in order to finance the acquisitions of\n', b'Coleman, Signature Brands and First Alert. The continuing cost of\n', b"servicing such debt could negatively effect the Company's future operations,\n", b'which effect could be material.\n', b'\n', b"     /bullet/ The Company's performance should be expected to be affected by\n", b'the strength of the retail economy, primarily in the United States, but also in\n', b'Canada, Latin America and Asia. Weakness in\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                                       7\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'consumer confidence and retail outlets (including the financial weakness or\n', b'bankruptcy of retail outlets, especially mass merchants) should be expected to\n', b"adversely impact the Company's future financial results. In addition, the\n", b'extended credit terms provided by the Company in connection with its "early buy"\n', b"program increase the Company's risk of collection of accounts receivable.\n", b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company operates in a highly competitive environment with\n', b'numerous competitors which are financially strong and capable of competing\n', b'effectively with the Company in the marketplace. Such competitors may take\n', b"actions to meet the Company's new product introductions and other initiatives.\n", b'Some competitors may be willing to accept lower margins and to reduce prices to\n', b'compete with the Company. As a result, the Company could fail to achieve\n', b'anticipated sales increases, to realize anticipated price increases, or\n', b'otherwise fail to meet its anticipated goals. Any of such circumstances would\n', b'likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance, which effect\n', b'could be material.\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company currently manufactures approximately 70% of its\n', b"products. One of the Company's goals for 1998 is to source approximately 50% of\n", b"the Company's parts and/or products from third parties. The Company's ability\n", b'to realize sales and operating profits at anticipated levels is dependent upon\n', b'its ability to timely manufacture, source and deliver products which may be\n', b'sold for a profit. Labor difficulties, delays in delivery or pricing of raw\n', b'materials and/or sourced products, scheduling and transportation difficulties,\n', b'management dislocations and delays in development and manufacture of new\n', b'products can negatively affect operating profits. Although the Company will use\n', b'its best efforts to select suppliers for sourced product which are reliable and\n', b"dependable, the Company's planned increase in the percentage of sourced\n", b"products will decrease the Company's immediate control of product and, if such\n", b'suppliers fail to deliver products as anticipated, could have an adverse effect\n', b'on future financial performance, which effect could be material.\n', b'\n', b"     /bullet/ As a consumer goods distributor, the Company's results of\n", b'operations can be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits, product\n', b'recall actions and/or by higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or\n', b'other returns of goods.\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company expects to substantially increase the amount of\n', b'business conducted by it outside North America. If the Company fails to achieve\n', b'anticipated market penetration in areas of the world into which the Company\n', b'currently expects to expand its sales, such event is likely to have an adverse\n', b"effect on the Company's future financial performance, which effect could be\n", b"material. Expansion of the Company's sales in foreign markets depends upon many\n", b'factors, including the states of economies in foreign countries, the strength\n', b'of consumer demand in those countries for products which the Company sells (or\n', b'expects to sell in those markets), the strength of competition from other\n', b'global consumer products companies and other factors which may negatively\n', b"affect the Company's anticipated performance in those markets. Although the\n", b'recent financial instability in Asia has not currently had any material impact\n', b'on the Company, if such conditions continue and/or worsen, they could\n', b"negatively impact the Company's ability to achieve anticipated sales growth in\n", b"such countries, the effect of which could be material to the Company's future\n", b'financial performance.\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company currently manufactures some products and has sales in\n', b'such economies as those of Mexico and Venezuela, both of which economies have\n', b'been unstable or hyperinflationary in recent years. The economies of other\n', b"foreign countries important to the Company's expansion plans, including other\n", b'countries in Latin America and Asia, could suffer similar instability in the\n', b'future. Such factors as currency devaluations, new tariffs, changes in monetary\n', b'policies, inflation, governmental instability and similar matters could\n', b"negatively affect the Company's anticipated performance in foreign markets.\n", b'Although the Company plans to take advantage of recent economic and currency\n', b"fluctuations in certain Asian countries by increasing the Company's purchases\n", b'of products from such countries at lower prices, there is no guarantee that\n', b'such purchasing advantage will be fulfilled or will fully overcome any lost\n', b'sales opportunities in those same countries. As a result, the economic\n', b'conditions discussed above or any of these circumstances could have an adverse\n', b'effect on future financial performance, which effect could be material.\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ A significant portion of the cost of goods manufactured by the\n', b'Company in North America is the cost of raw materials and/or components. The\n', b'Company has implemented changes in its purchasing\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                                       8\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'function which have enabled the Company to purchase materials more efficiently\n', b"and economically than it has in the past. The future success of the Company's\n", b"purchasing initiatives may be affected by many factors beyond the Company's\n", b'control, such as commodity pricing generally and higher prices for the specific\n', b'materials required by the Company. Although there are numerous suppliers\n', b'available for the materials and components sourced by the Company, any\n', b'unanticipated change in suppliers could be disruptive and costly to the\n', b"Company. In addition, the Company's future initiatives to reduce the cost of\n", b'materials simply may not achieve savings in amounts comparable to those\n', b'previously obtained by the Company. A significant failure by the Company to\n', b'maintain material costs as anticipated would likely have an adverse effect on\n', b'anticipated future financial performance, which effect could be material.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company anticipates realizing price increases from time to\n', b'time for certain of its products. The Company operates in a highly competitive\n', b'industry, and its ability to realize price increases may be limited due to\n', b'competitive pressures. If there is a material failure to realize anticipated\n', b'price increases, margins likely will be lower than anticipated by the Company,\n', b'and this will likely have an adverse effect on future financial performance,\n', b'which effect could be material.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company anticipates that it will be able to more rapidly\n', b'develop and introduce a substantial number of new and innovative products in\n', b'the future. However, the Company may prove unable to meet its more aggressive\n', b'schedules for future product development. Failure to develop and manufacture\n', b'new products in the amounts and with the quality anticipated or a failure to\n', b'reduce the cycle time for new product introductions would likely have an\n', b'adverse effect on future financial performance, which effect could be material.\n', b' \n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     /bullet/ Sales of certain of the Company's products can be negatively\n", b'impacted by unseasonable weather conditions during different seasons and\n', b"quarters of the year. For instance, the Company's sales of warming blankets\n", b'were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 1997 by moderate temperatures\n', b'in the northern states. The Company has attempted to levelize production,\n', b'marketing and other activities related to seasonal products by implementing an\n', b'"early buy" program; such a program shifts certain of the weather related risks\n', b'of negative sales impact for such seasonal products to later months of the\n', b'season and, as result, could have a negative impact on future financial\n', b'performance.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     /bullet/ The Company has entered into various arrangements with third\n', b'parties for the provision of back-office administrative services previously\n', b'provided with internal resources, including provision of all necessary computer\n', b'systems. Failure of any of these third party service providers to perform in\n', b'accordance with their respective agreements with the Company could result in\n', b"disruptions of the Company's normal business operations with a consequent\n", b'impact on sales, collections, cash flow and/or profitability.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     /bullet/ The Company's profitability may be negatively impacted by\n", b'underabsorption of manufacturing costs resulting from underutilization of\n', b"manufacturing capacity if the Company's sales growth is less than anticipated.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'                                       9\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n", b'        OF OPERATION\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 1996\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     In November 1996, the Company initiated a major restructuring and growth\n', b'plan designed to substantially reduce its cost structure and grow the business\n', b'in order to restore higher levels of profitability for the Company. By July\n', b'1997, the Company completed the major phases of the restructuring plan. The\n', b'$225.0 million of annualized cost savings anticipated from the restructuring\n', b'results primarily from the consolidation of administrative functions within the\n', b'Company, the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities\n', b'(including a reduction in the number of production facilities from 26 to 8 and\n', b'warehouses from 61 to 18), the elimination of over 6,000 positions (including\n', b'3,300 from the divestiture of non-core businesses described below and\n', b"approximately 2,800 other positions), the centralization of the Company's\n", b'procurement function and re-negotiation of supply contracts resulting in\n', b'procurement savings for raw materials, components and sourced finished products\n', b"and the reduction of the Company's product offerings and stock keeping units\n", b'("SKU\'s"). The restructuring and growth plan also included a redefinition of the\n', b"Company's core product categories and the elimination of those businesses and\n", b"product lines that did not fit the core categories. Sunbeam's core product\n", b'categories are Appliances, Health at Home, Personal Care and Comfort, Outdoor\n', b'Cooking and Away From Home. Product categories and businesses determined to be\n', b"non-core were divested in 1997, including the Company's furniture business and\n", b'its time and temperature, decorative bedding and Counselor/registered trademark/\n', b'and Borg/registered trademark/ scale product lines. In addition, the Company\n', b'sold its textile mill in Biddeford, Maine in 1997.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Net sales from continuing operations for 1997 were $1,168.2 million, an\n', b'increase of $183.9 million or 18.7% over 1996. Net sales on a normalized basis,\n', b'after excluding divested product lines which are not classified as discontinued\n', b'operations (time and temperature products, decorative bedding and\n', b'Counselor/registered trademark/ and Borg/registered trademark/ branded scales),\n', b'increased 22.4% during the year.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Global sales, on a normalized basis, increased during 1997 in all five of\n', b"the Company's product categories primarily from new product introductions,\n", b"improved distribution (particularly with the Company's top ten customers),\n", b'international geographic expansion and improved price realization for certain\n', b'products. Global sales growth on a normalized basis exceeded 25% in the\n', b'Appliance, Outdoor Cooking and Away From Home categories with sales increases\n', b'of 26.8%, 27.2% and 28.6%, respectively. Sales in the Health at Home category\n', b'increased 10.7% on a normalized basis and sales in the Personal Care and\n', b'Comfort category increased 3.4% during 1997.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     The Company's Appliance category sales increases were driven by new\n", b'products, such as re-designed blenders and mixers, coffeemakers, irons, deep\n', b'fryers and toasters, and by increased distribution with large national mass\n', b'retailers. Sales of Outdoor Cooking products increased in 1997 after three\n', b'straight years of declines as a result of increased merchandising and\n', b'advertising programs, new distribution and the introduction of an entirely new\n', b'line of grills and accessories for the 1998 season that began to ship in the\n', b'fourth quarter of 1997 under a new "early buy" marketing program that included\n', b'among other things, extended credit terms with due dates in the second quarter\n', b'of 1998. The Company sold approximately $50.0 million of Outdoor Cooking\n', b'Products under this program in the fourth quarter of 1997. The early buy program\n', b'for Outdoor Cooking products is designed to improve customer service levels and\n', b'production efficiencies with more level seasonal production and distribution\n', b'activities that have historically peaked in the first half of each year and to\n', b'drive additional retail sell-through of Outdoor Cooking products by reducing the\n', b'likelihood of retail stock-outs during the important first and second quarter\n', b'1998 selling season.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Sales of Personal Care and Comfort products were up over 30% through\n', b'September 1997, but suffered during the fourth quarter as a result of lower\n', b'than expected retail sell through of electric blankets in key northern markets\n', b'in late 1997 coupled with the inability to service demand for king and queen\n', b'sized blankets due to shortages of blanket shells. The Company anticipates\n', b'shifting to a more\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                                       14\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'level production for blankets in 1998 in order to more adequately service the\n', b'seasonal demand for bedding products. Health at Home category sales increased\n', b'as a result of new products and improved distribution in the drug channels.\n', b'Away from Home sales increased in 1997 as a result of new products, including\n', b'cordless clippers and titanium blades coupled with increased distribution of\n', b"commercially rated appliances. Also contributing to the Company's sales growth\n", b'in 1997 were its new retail outlet stores, of which 22 were open by the end of\n', b'1997.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     International sales, which represented 21% of total revenues in 1997, grew\n', b'31.2% during the year. This sales growth was driven primarily by 54 new 220\n', b'volt product introductions and the execution of 25 new international\n', b'distribution and license agreements. Revenue growth of approximately 34% was\n', b"achieved both in Mexico and by the Company's Latin American export sales\n", b'organization, and sales in Venezuela and Canada increased approximately 23%\n', b'each. European sales fell slightly in 1997, however the Company expects that\n', b'expanded electric blanket and clipper sales along with the help of additional\n', b'new distribution agreements will benefit European sales in 1998.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The gross margin percentage for 1997 increased 19.8 percentage points to\n', b'28.3%. This increase reflects the results of many cost savings and margin\n', b"enhancement initiatives undertaken as part of the Company's restructuring plan\n", b'coupled with the incremental margin attributable to new products and higher\n', b"revenues associated with the Company's growth plan. The Company initiated a\n", b'manufacturing refinement program in the second quarter of 1997 targeted at\n', b'aggressively improving factory productivity at all of its remaining operations,\n', b'including the Neosho, Missouri Outdoor Cooking Products facility which suffered\n', b'from poor productivity and operating inefficiencies during the 1997 grill\n', b'season. The benefits of the refinement program began to favorably impact\n', b'factory productivity in several factories during the third quarter of 1997. The\n', b'refinement of the Neosho facility, which was completed prior to the initiation\n', b'of production for the 1998 grill season in the fourth quarter, included a\n', b'revised plant layout to improve material flow, increased usage of common parts\n', b'in the manufacturing process and modifications to the paint system to increase\n', b'capacity and throughput.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Operating earnings for 1997 were $199.4 million, an increase of $195.0\n', b'million over 1996, excluding the impact of the 1996 special charge. As a\n', b'percentage of sales, the operating margin of 17.1% increased 16.6 percentage\n', b"points above last year's operating margin, excluding 1996 special charges. The\n", b'operating margin improvements for 1997 were the result of the improved gross\n', b'margin discussed above and lower selling, general and administrative ("SG&A")\n', b'costs in 1997 associated with the consolidation of six divisional and regional\n', b'headquarters into one corporate headquarters and one administrative operations\n', b'center, reduced staffing levels, the outsourcing of certain administrative and\n', b'distribution functions, a reduction in the number of warehouses, and Company\n', b'wide cost control initiatives. In addition, SG&A during 1996 included\n', b'incremental compensation costs associated with restricted stock awards and\n', b'other costs related to the employment of a new senior management team, higher\n', b'than normal expenditures for market research, packaging and other initiatives\n', b"related to the launch of the Company's growth plan, and higher bad debt\n", b"expenses associated with certain of the Company's customers. The cost reduction\n", b'initiatives and one time items in 1996 coupled with increased sales in 1997\n', b'resulted in SG&A decreasing as a percentage of sales from 17.4% in 1996\n', b'(excluding the impact of special charges) to 11.2% for 1997.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Interest expense decreased from $13.6 million in 1996 to $11.4 million in\n', b'1997 primarily as a result of lower average borrowing levels in 1997 due to\n', b'improved cash flows.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The effective income tax of 35% for 1997 and 1996 for earnings (loss) from\n', b'continuing operations was lower than the statutory federal and state rates as a\n', b'result of lower foreign taxes from the utilization of foreign tax credits and\n', b'loss carryforwards and lower state income taxes as a result of certain state\n', b'income tax credits.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     The Company's diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was\n", b'$1.41 per share versus a loss per share from continuing operations in 1996 of\n', b"$2.37. The Company's share base utilized in the diluted earnings per share\n", b'calculation increased approximately 6% during 1997 as a result of an increase\n', b'in the number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents\n', b'outstanding due to the exercise of stock options and a higher market value of\n', b"the Company's common stock in 1997.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'                                       15\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b"     The Company's discontinued furniture operations, which were sold in March\n", b'1997, had revenues of $51.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 prior to the\n', b'sale and break-even earnings. In 1996, the discontinued furniture operations\n', b'had net income of $.8 million on revenues of $227.5 million and an estimated\n', b'loss on disposal of the business of $32.4 million, net of applicable income tax\n', b"benefits.

This sales decline was\n', b'driven by lower sales of outdoor cooking products, which declined 7.3% and\n', b'lower sales of bedding products which declined 9.0% from 1995, primarily as\n', b'result of lower decorative bedding sales (divested in December 1996). Domestic\n', b'sales of appliance products were flat with sales increases from new products\n', b'such as vegetable steamers and toaster ovens being offset by reduced pricing on\n', b'breadmakers.

In addition, a $12.0 million fourth quarter 1996 media\n', b'advertising campaign and one-time expenditures for market research, new\n', b'packaging, and other growth plan initiatives resulted in higher than normal\n', b'SG&A spending in 1996.

This revenue growth was\n', b'the result of the acquisition of the Samsonite/registered trademark/ furniture\n', b'business in November 1995. Excluding the impact of this acquisition, furniture\n', b'business sales declined 2.1%. Earnings from the discontinued furniture\n', b'operations, net of taxes, declined from $12.9 million in 1995 to $.8 million in\n', b'1996 primarily as a result of lower gross margins from reduced pricing,\n', b'underabsorption of higher manufacturing costs and higher raw material costs. In\n', b'addition, SG&A costs increased due to the inclusion of the Samsonite/registered\n', b'trademark/ furniture business, higher distribution and warehousing costs,\n', b'particularly with resin furniture products and higher bad debt expenses.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'FOREIGN OPERATIONS\n', b'\n', b'\n', b"     During 1997 approximately 90% of the Company's business was conducted in\n", b'U.S. dollars (including both domestic sales, U.S. dollar denominated export\n', b'sales primarily to certain Latin American markets, Asian sales and the majority\n', b"of European sales). The Company's exposure to market risk from changes in\n", b"foreign currency and interest rates is generally insignificant. The Company's\n", b'non-U.S. dollar denominated sales are made principally by subsidiaries in\n', b'Mexico, Venezuela and Canada. Venezuela is considered a hyperinflationary\n', b'economy for accounting purposes for 1995, 1996 and 1997 and Mexico reverted to\n', b'hyperinflationary status for accounting purposes in 1997; therefore, translation\n', b'adjustments related to Venezuelan and Mexican net monetary assets are included\n', b'as a component of net earnings. Such translation adjustments were not material\n', b'to 1995, 1996 and 1997 operating results.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     On a limited basis, the Company selectively uses derivatives (foreign\n', b'exchange option and forward contracts) to manage foreign exchange exposures\n', b'that arise in the normal course of business. No derivative contracts are\n', b'entered into for trading or speculative purposes. The use of derivatives did\n', b"not have a material impact on the Company's financial results in 1995, 1996 and\n", b"1997.

This decrease is primarily\n', b'attributable to an increase in earnings before non-cash charges in 1997 and the\n', b"utilization of tax benefits generated from the implementation of the Company's\n", b'restructuring plan, offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased sales\n', b'in 1997 and certain seasonal dating terms, increased inventory levels in 1997\n', b"necessary to support continued anticipated sales growth and the Company's\n", b'initiatives to improve customer service levels and 1997 cash expenditures\n', b'required to implement the restructuring plan. In addition, cash used in\n', b'operating activities reflects $59 million of proceeds from the sale of trade\n', b"accounts receivable under the Company's revolving trade accounts receivable\n", b'securitization program entered into in December 1997 as more fully described in\n', b"Note 3 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'     Capital spending totaled $58.3 million in 1997 and was primarily for new\n', b'products, cost reduction and capacity expansion initiatives. Capital spending\n', b'in 1996 was $75.3 million (including $14.5 million related to the discontinued\n', b'furniture operations) and was primarily attributable to new product\n', b'development, cost reduction initiatives and a $5.0 million warehouse expansion\n', b'financed with a capital lease. Capital spending in 1995 reflected approximately\n', b'$59.4 million associated with the Hattiesburg facility, $27.4 million related\n', b'to new product development and $10.8 million attributable to the discontinued\n', b'furniture business. The remaining 1995 capital spending was related to cost\n', b'reduction projects, productivity initiatives and environmental compliance\n', b'including $14.4 million for a powder coat paint system for Outdoor Cooking\n', b'products. The Company anticipates 1998 capital spending to be approximately 5%\n', b'of sales and primarily related to new product introductions, capacity additions\n', b'and certain facility rationalization initiatives.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Cash provided by investing activities also reflects $91.0 million in\n', b'proceeds from sales of businesses, assets and product categories determined to\n', b"be non-core to the Company's ongoing operations in conjunction with the 1996\n", b'restructuring plan. Cash used in investing activities for 1995 includes the\n', b"purchase of a portion of the Company's furniture business, which was\n", b'subsequently divested in full in March 1997.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Cash provided by financing activities totaled $16.4 million in 1997 and\n', b"reflects net borrowings of $5.0 million under the Company's revolving credit\n", b'facility, $12.2 million of debt repayments related to the divested furniture\n', b'operations and other assets sold and $26.6 million in cash proceeds from the\n', b'exercise of stock options, substantially all by former employees of the\n', b'Company. In 1996, cash provided by financing activities of $45.3 million was\n', b'primarily from increased revolving credit facility borrowings to support\n', b'working capital and capital spending requirements, $11.5 million in new\n', b'issuances of long-term debt and $4.6 million in proceeds from the sale of\n', b'treasury shares to certain executives of the Company. In July 1997, the Company\n', b'reduced the amount of available borrowings under its September 1996 unsecured\n', b'five year revolving credit facility from $500 million to $250 million.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Company is a party to various environmental proceedings, substantially\n', b"all related to previously divested operations. In connection with the Company's\n", b'restructuring plan a comprehensive review of environmental exposures was\n', b'undertaken and the Company accelerated its strategy for the resolution and\n', b'settlement of certain environmental claims. This review and change in strategy\n', b'resulted in additional environmental reserves being recorded in 1996 as more\n', b'fully described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. In\n', b"management's opinion, the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters\n", b"will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'     On March 2, 1998, the Company announced the signing of definitive\n', b'agreements to acquire The Coleman Company, Inc., Signature Brands USA, Inc. and\n', b'First Alert, Inc. Completion of the acquisitions, which is expected in the\n', b'second quarter of 1998, is contingent on customary conditions, including\n', b'regulatory approvals, and acquisition debt issuances. In connection with the\n', b'acquisitions, the Company plans to refinance existing revolving and term debt of\n', b'the acquired companies as well as all or substantially all of its existing\n', b'long-term debt. The Company expects to finance the cash portion of the\n', b'acquisitions and all debt refinancings through a combination of new revolving\n', b'and term credit facilities and zero coupon notes that will be issued concurrent\n', b'with the acquisition closings.

As of December 28, 1997, the Company had been identified as a\n', b'potentially responsible party ("PRP") in connection with seven sites subject to\n', b'the federal Superfund law and two sites subject to state Superfund laws\n', b'comparable to the federal law (collectively the "Environmental Sites"),\n', b'exclusive of sites at which the Company has been designated (or expects to be\n', b'designated) as a de minimis (less than 1%) participant. Substantially all of\n', b'these sites relate to divested operations of the Company.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Company currently is engaged in active remediation activities at nine\n', b'sites, four of which are among the Environmental Sites referred to above, and\n', b'five of which have not been designated as Superfund sites under federal or\n', b'state law. In addition, the Company is engaged in environmental remediation\n', b'activities at a site in Newburgh Heights, Ohio, where a subsidiary formerly\n', b'conducted\n', b'\n', b'                                      F-25\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'                     SUNBEAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n', b'\n', b'            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES--(CONTINUED)\n', b'\n', b'operations. The Company has been actively cooperating with the United States\n', b'Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory authorities in developing a\n', b'plan for remediation of this site; which remediation is expected to be\n', b'substantially completed during 1998.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Company has established reserves, in accordance with SFAS No. 5,\n', b'Accounting for Contingencies, to cover the anticipated probable costs of\n', b'remediation, based upon periodic reviews of all sites for which the Company\n', b'has, or may have remediation responsibility. As of December 28, 1997, the\n', b"amount of such reserves was less than 5% of the Company's total liabilities as\n", b'set forth in the consolidated financial statements. Liability under the\n', b'Superfund law is joint and several and is imposed on a strict basis, without\n', b'regard to degree of negligence or culpability. As a result, the Company\n', b"recognizes its responsibility to determine whether other PRP's at a Superfund\n", b'site are financially capable of paying their respective shares of the ultimate\n', b'cost of remediation of the site. Whenever the Company has determined that a\n', b'particular PRP is not financially responsible, it has assumed for purposes of\n', b'establishing reserve amounts that such PRP will not pay its respective share of\n', b"the costs of remediation. To minimize the Company's potential liability with\n", b'respect to the Environmental Sites, the Company has actively participated in\n', b"steering committees and other groups of PRP's established with respect to such\n", b'sites. The Company continues to pursue the recovery of some environmental\n', b'remediation costs from certain of its liability insurance carriers; however,\n', b'such potential recoveries have not been offset against potential liabilities\n', b"and have not been considered in determining the Company's environmental\n", b'reserves.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     Due to uncertainty over remedial measures to be adopted at some sites, the\n', b'possibility of changes in environmental laws and regulations and the fact that\n', b'joint and several liability with the right of contribution is possible at\n', b"federal and state Superfund sites, the Company's ultimate future liability with\n", b'respect to sites at which remediation has not been completed may vary from the\n', b"amounts reserved as of December 28, 1997. In connection with the Company's\n", b'restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of 1996 a comprehensive review of all\n', b'environmental exposures was performed, and the Company accelerated its strategy\n', b'for the resolution and settlement of certain environmental claims. As a result,\n', b'the Company recorded additional environmental reserves of approximately $9.0\n', b'million in the fourth quarter of 1996. The Company believes, based on existing\n', b'information, that the costs of completing environmental remediation of all\n', b'sites for which the Company has a remediation responsibility have been\n', b'adequately reserved, and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not\n', b"have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial condition.\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'LEASES\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'     The Company rents certain facilities, equipment and retail stores under\n', b'operating leases. Rental expense for operating leases amounted to $7.4 million\n', b'in 1997, $8.0 million for 1996 and $8.6 million for 1995.

GROSS-UP FOR EXCISE TAX. In the event that the Executive receives any\n', b'payment or benefit (including but not limited to the payments or benefits\n', b'pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement) (a "Payment") that is subject to the\n', b'excise tax (the "Excise Tax") under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of\n', b'1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company shall pay to the Executive, as soon\n', b'thereafter as practicable, an additional amount (a "Gross-Up Payment") such that\n', b'the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax\n', b'imposed upon the Payment and any federal, state and local income tax and Excise\n', b'Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment shall be equal to the Payment. The\n', b'determination of whether an Excise Tax is due in respect of any payment or\n', b'benefit, the amount of the Excise Tax and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment\n', b'shall be made by an independent auditor (the "Auditor") jointly selected by the\n', b'Company and the Executive and paid by the Company.

In the\n', b'event the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less than the amount\n', b'used to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive or the Company, as the\n', b'case may be, shall pay to the other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax\n', b'or such income tax, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate\n', b'provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.\n', b'\n', b'                                        12\n', b'\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'13.

If, at\n', b'any time, the provisions of this Section 14(c) shall be determined to be invalid\n', b'or unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to area, duration\n', b'or scope of activity, this Section 14(c) shall be considered divisible and shall\n', b'become and be immediately amended to only such area, duration and scope of\n', b'activity as shall be determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or\n', b'other body having jurisdiction over the matter; and the Executive agrees that\n', b'this Section 14(c) as so amended shall be valid and binding as though any\n', b'invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein. For purposes of\n', b'this Section 14(c), the design, manufacture and marketing of outdoor barbecue\n', b'grills and small kitchen appliances shall be construed to be a Competitive\n', b'Business; provided, however, that the gross revenues derived from sales of such\n', b'products by such competitor are greater than the lesser of (i) 10% of its total\n', b'revenues and (ii) $500,000,000.\n', b'\n', b'        (d) REMEDIES.

In the event that the Executive\n', b'receives any payment or benefit (including but not limited to the payments or\n', b'benefits pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement) (a "Payment") that is subject\n', b'to the excise tax (the "Excise Tax") under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue\n', b'Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company shall pay to the Executive,\n', b'as soon thereafter as practicable, an additional amount (a "Gross-Up Payment")\n', b'such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any\n', b'Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment and any federal, state and local income tax\n', b'and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment shall be equal to the Payment.\n', b'The determination of whether an Excise Tax is due in respect of any payment or\n', b'benefit, the amount of the Excise Tax and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment\n', b'shall be made by an independent auditor (the "Auditor") jointly selected by the\n', b'Company and the Executive and paid by the Company.

In the\n', b'event the actual Excise Tax or such income tax is more or less than the amount\n', b'used to calculate the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive or the Company, as the\n', b'case may be, shall pay to the other an amount reflecting the actual Excise Tax\n', b'or such income tax, plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate\n', b'provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.\n', b'\n', b'                 13.

THE PLAN, THE COMPANY. SUNBEAM CORPORATION (formerly known as Sunbeam-Oster\n', b'Company, Inc.) (the "Company") established the Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc. Execu\n', b'tive Benefit Retirement Plan effective as of December 15, 1994, and hereby\n', b'adopts the amendment and restatement of the plan, now known as SUNBEAM\n', b'CORPORATION EXEC UTIVE BENEFIT REPLACEMENT PLAN (the "Plan"). The Plan as set\n', b'forth herein is effec tive December 15, 1994 (the "Effective Date"), except as\n', b'otherwise specifically provided.\n', b'\n', b'1.2. EMPLOYERS. The Company and each other organization that is an employer\n', b'under SUN BEAM CORPORATION 401(k) SAVINGS AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN (the "401(k)\n', b'Plan") shall be an "Employer" under this Plan unless specified to the contrary\n', b'by the Company by writing filed with the Committee described in subsection 1.4.\n', b'\n', b'1.3. PURPOSE. The Company and certain related businesses maintain and are\n', b'employers under the 401(k) Plan, which is intended to meet the requirements of a\n', b'"qualified plan" under Sec tion 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose\n', b'of this Plan, a nonqualified plan, is generally to provide for eligible\n', b'employees benefits that such employees do not earn under the 401(k) Plan because\n', b'such employees do not participate in the 401(k) Plan.\n', b'\n', b'The Plan generally will allow Participants to elect to "make" before-tax\n', b'contributions to the Plan in the same amount and same manner as under the terms\n', b'of the 401(k) Plan; the Employ ers will provide "matching contributions" based\n', b"on a Participant's before-tax contributions; lastly, the Employers will\n", b'\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'provide "profit sharing contributions" allocated based on each Participant\'s\n', b'Compensation for a year. This Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily for\n', b'the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management\n', b'or highly-compensated employees, as such plans are described in Sections 201(2),\n', b'301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n', b'"Contributions" to the Plan are reflected through credits to bookkeeping\n', b'accounts that are adjusted periodically to reflect hypothetical investment\n', b'earnings. Participants are entitled to receive from the general assets of the\n', b'Employers cash payments equal to the vested portion of their account balances,\n', b'as set forth in the Plan.\n', b'\n', b'1.4. PLAN ADMINISTRATION. The Plan is administered by the administrative\n', b'committee (the "Committee") that is responsible for administration of the 401(k)\n', b'Plan. To the extent appropriate, the Committee has the same powers, rights,\n', b'duties and obligations as are vested in the committee responsible for\n', b'administration of the 401(k) Plan.\n', b'\n', b'1.5. COMPENSATION. For purposes of computing contributions and benefits under\n', b'the Plan, an employee\'s "Compensation" shall mean his compensation as defined\n', b'from time to time in Section 1.14 of the 401(k) Plan, determined, however,\n', b'without regard to any limits under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue\n', b'Code.\n', b'\n', b'                                    SECTION 2\n', b'\n', b'                          ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION\n', b'\n', b'2.1. COVERED EMPLOYEE. A "Covered Employee" means an employee of an Employer\n', b"under the Plan who is selected by the Company's board of directors or by a\n", b'person or committee authorized to act on behalf of the board of directors. An\n', b'employee who is selected shall con tinue as a Covered Employee until he\n', b'terminates employment with all Employers or until he is removed as a Covered\n', b"Employee by the Company's board of directors or by the\n", b'\n', b'                                      -2-\n', b'\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'person or committee authorized to act on its behalf effective as of the end of a\n', b'calendar year, whichever occurs first.\n', b'\n', b'2.2. ELIGIBILITY. Subject to the conditions and limitations of the Plan, an\n', b'employee of an Em ployer shall become eligible to enroll in this Plan and shall\n', b'become a "Participant" on the first date occurring on or after the Effective\n', b'Date on which he is a Covered Employee.\n', b'\n', b'2.3. PERIOD OF PARTICIPATION. An employee of an Employer who becomes a\n', b'Participant in this Plan will continue as a Participant in the Plan in\n', b'accordance with its provisions until all bene fits to which he is entitled under\n', b'the Plan have been distributed to him.\n', b'\n', b'                                    SECTION 3\n', b'\n', b'                                    BENEFITS\n', b'\n', b'3.1. INTENT. Commencing on the Effective Date, the provisions of this Section 3\n', b'are intended to allow a Participant to elect to make before-tax contributions,\n', b'to earn "matching contribu tions" that are at the same rate as those made by his\n', b'Employer on behalf of 401(k) Plan Partic ipants, and to earn "profit sharing\n', b'contributions" at the same rate as those made on behalf of participants under\n', b'the 401(k) Plan.\n', b'\n', b'3.2. BEFORE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS.\n', b'\n', b'         (a)      For 1994, a Participant may elect to make Before-Tax\n', b'                  Contributions of any or all of his Compensation attributable\n', b'                  to services performed after the Effective Date (but not more\n', b'                  than $9,240). Beginning January 1, 1995, a Participant may\n', b'                  elect to make Before-Tax Contributions in whole multiples of\n', b'                  his Compensation from 1% to 10%, but not in excess of the\n', b'                  amount by which Before-Tax Contributions are limited in the\n', b'\n', b'                                      -3-\n', b'\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                  401(k) Plan because of Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue\n', b"                  Code. A Participant's Before-Tax Contributions under this\n", b'                  subsection 3.2 shall be made pursuant to a compensation\n', b'                  deferral election by which the Participant elects to have his\n', b'                  Compensation reduced by the amount provided in the election,\n', b"                  and the Employer shall credit such amount to the Participant's\n", b'                  account as provided in subsection 3.6.\n', b'\n', b"         (b)      An election shall be filed with the Participant's Employer\n", b'                  prior to the calendar year such contributions are to begin,\n', b'                  or, for contributions to be made in 1994, within ten days of\n', b'                  the Effective Date. If a Participant first becomes eligible to\n', b'                  make such contributions after the Effective Date and during,\n', b'                  but after the beginning of, any subsequent calendar year, such\n', b"                  Participant's deferral election must be filed with his Em\n", b'                  ployer not more than 30 days after so becoming eligible.\n', b'\n', b"         (c)      A Participant's compensation deferral election under this\n", b'                  subsection 3.2 shall apply to Compensation otherwise payable\n', b'                  after the later to occur of the date the Participant becomes\n', b'                  eligible to make Before-Tax Contri butions and the date the\n', b"                  election is filed with his Employer. A Partici pant's\n", b'                  compensation deferral election, however, may be revoked by the\n', b'                  Participant before the beginning of any subsequent calendar\n', b'                  year. The revocation shall be effective as to Compensation the\n', b'                  Participant is enti tled to receive during that and subsequent\n', b'                  calendar years unless prior to the commencement of any\n', b'                  subsequent calendar year the Participant makes another\n', b'                  compensation deferral election. Such later election shall\n', b'                  apply as to Compensation otherwise payable during calendar\n', b'                  years beginning after such later election is made.\n', b'\n', b"         (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant's compensation\n", b'                  deferral election automatically\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                                      -4-\n', b'\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                  shall be revoked for any period he ceases, in the sole opinion\n', b'                  of the Committee, to be a member of a select group of\n', b'                  management or a highly-compensated employee.\n', b'\n', b'3.3.  EMPLOYER MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS.\n', b'\n', b"         (a)      For 1994, a Participant's Employer shall make a matching\n", b"                  contribution equal to 50% of the Participant's Before-Tax\n", b"                  Contributions for 1994; in addition the Participant's Employer\n", b'                  shall make a matching contribution equal to the matching\n', b'                  contribution the Participant is precluded from receiving under\n', b'                  the 401(k) Plan because of the limits of Internal Reve nue\n', b'                  Code Section 401(m). In no event will the matching\n', b'                  contribution for 1994 exceed $4,620.\n', b'\n', b'         (b)      Beginning January 1, 1995, each calendar quarter a\n', b"                  Participant's Em ployer shall make a matching contribution on\n", b"                  behalf of the Participant equal to 100% of the Participant's\n", b'                  Before-Tax Contributions (disregard ing Before-Tax\n', b"                  Contributions in excess of 2% of a Participant's Compensation)\n", b'                  and 50% of the additional Before-Tax Contributions\n', b'                  (disregarding such contributions in excess of 4% of\n', b'                  Compensation) during the quarter, provided the Participant is\n', b'                  employed by an Em ployer on the last day of the quarter.\n', b'\n', b'         (c)      In addition, beginning with the 1995 calendar year, a\n', b"                  Participant's Em ployer shall make an additional matching\n", b'                  contribution on behalf of the Participant as of the last day\n', b'                  of each calendar quarter so that the match ing contributions\n', b"                  for the Participant are equal to 100% of the Participant's\n", b'                  Before-Tax Contributions (disregarding Before-Tax Con\n', b"                  tributions in excess of 2% of the Participant's Compensation)\n", b'                  and 50% of the additional Before-Tax Contributions\n', b'                  (disregarding such contribu tions in excess of 4% of\n', b'                  Compensation) during the year, provided the\n', b'\n', b'                                      -5-\n', b'\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'                  Participant is employed by an Employer on the last day of the\n', b'                  quarter.\n', b'\n', b'         (d)      Such Employer contributions shall be called "Employer Matching\n', b'                  Con tributions."

Before the 1996 special charges taken by the Company to\n', b'restructure and reposition Sunbeam, earnings per share (diluted) from continuing\n', b'operations of $0.47 were $0.50 ahead of the loss of $0.03 reported in the fourth\n', b'quar ter last year. Including these charges earnings per share (diluted) rose\n', b'$2.76 above the reported $2.29 loss reported in 1996. On a year to date basis,\n', b'revenue of $1.168 billion was 22.4% above 1996 on a comparable basis and\n', b'earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations of $1.41 was $1.51 above\n', b'the loss of $0.10 reported in 1996, excluding special charges. For the full year\n', b'of 1997, earnings per share (diluted) rose $3.78 from the loss of $2.37 reported\n', b'in 1996.\n', b'\n', b'1997 Highlights -- During 1997, the Company completed its restructuring program\n', b'and initiated a growth strategy that has generated consistent quarterly double\n', b'digit sales growth throughout the year. The company exited all its non-core\n', b'businesses in 1997, closed 18 factories, 43 warehouses and 5 headquarters,\n', b'reduced employment by approximately 50% (half of which reflects reductions\n', b'related to the disposition of non-core businesses) and substantially reduced its\n', b'SKU offerings as part of its restructuring program. Concurrent with the\n', b'restructuring program, the Company also implemented a three year growth plan to\n', b'strengthen the Sunbeam(R) and Oster(R) brand names and expand distribution\n', b"globally. Albert J. Dunlap, Sunbeam's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said\n", b'"I am very proud of the dramatic turnaround that we have achieved at Sunbeam in\n', b'such a short period of time as we continue to execute against our three year\n', b'growth plans. Our continu ous sales increases of 13%, 17%, 28% and 31% in the\n', b'four quarters of 1997, for an overall sales increase of 22% for the year, are a\n', b'clear indication that our strategy is working."\n', b'\n', b"The Company's three year strategy to achieve $1 billion in revenue growth, which\n", b'it embarked upon in 1997, was fueled by the addition of 25 international\n', b'distribution/license agreements, the introduction of 35 new U.S. products and 54\n', b'new international products along with the contribu tion from 22 factory outlet\n', b'stores. "We experienced sales growth in all major channels of distri bution, in\n', b'all regions of the world and in each of our five global businesses, and we\n', b'gained market share in all of our key product categories, reversing a three year\n', b'downward trend, " said Mr. Dunlap. Sales to the Company\'s top 10 retailers were\n', b'up 15% and 22% in the latest quarter and\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'full year, respectively. International sales which are projected to contribute\n', b"40% of the Company's three year growth goal, were up 42%, and 34% for the\n", b'quarter and full year, respectively. Leading the sales growth internationally\n', b'was the Asia/Pacific region, up 425%, and the Latin American region, up 32%.\n', b'"The primary catalyst for this growth has been our ability to improve customer\n', b'service levels and introduce innovative and differentiated new products at an\n', b'accelerated pace. As part of the restructuring we implemented a new product\n', b'development process that has enabled us to reduce new product development time\n', b'from over 2 years to approximately 6 months," said Mr. Dunlap.\n', b'\n', b'"Equally as important as our strong top line growth was the remarkable\n', b'improvement in operating margins, year over year, and the continuous margin\n', b'expansion we delivered through-out the year. We set a three year goal to have\n', b'20% operating margins, and we were essentially at that level in the 3rd and 4th\n', b'quarters this year," said Mr. Dunlap. The Company\'s operating margins of 20% in\n', b'the 4th quarter and 17% for the full year reflect the numerous initiatives\n', b'associated with the restructuring program. "I am pleased with the pace of\n', b'improvements in our financial performance and expect continued margin\n', b'enhancement in 1998," Mr. Dunlap said.\n', b'\n', b'1998 Goals -- The Company announced its goals for 1998, which anticipate\n', b'increases in sales and margins at rates above those experienced in 1997. Mr.\n', b'Dunlap, commenting on the Company\'s 1998 revenue goals, said, "We have\n', b'established sales growth goals that should exceed the impres sive results\n', b'reported in 1997. In 1998 we will continue our global expansion with the\n', b'addition of 30 new global products, a dozen more international\n', b'distribution/license agreements and 10 more outlet stores. We expect to double\n', b'our media advertising spending to stimulate increased consumer pull for our\n', b'products and introduce new in-store merchandising programs to assist our retail\n', b'partners in the promotion and support of our aggressive growth goals." The\n', b'Company expects to introduce new products in 1998 that will strengthen its\n', b'global product lines, and market positions, by focusing on technological\n', b'innovation that satisfies chronic consumer needs.\n', b'\n', b"Commenting on the effect of the economic situation in Asia on the Company's\n", b'international growth plans, Mr. Dunlap stated, "Sunbeam has an advantage in that\n', b'we started from a very low base. Unlike other companies which have exported\n', b'heavily to Asia for years, we still have an ex cellent opportunity to build our\n', b'business rapidly in that region of the world. Our plans are to ini tially sell\n', b'our most highly differentiated products in Asia, like our electric blankets,\n', b'blenders, wa ter and air purifiers, hair clippers and ToastLogic(R) products.\n', b'Many of the products we will sell there can be sourced from Asian OEM\n', b'manufacturers, providing flexibility to enhance our growth opportunities in the\n', b'Asia/Pacific region."\n', b'\n', b'Mr. Dunlap said, "I am confident that we have the right initiatives in place to\n', b'achieve our goals and further expand operating margins in 1998." The Company\n', b'plans to increase the amount of out-sourcing in 1998 to help support its sales\n', b'growth objectives for the Asia/Pacific region and to allow for added capacity\n', b'without adding bricks and mortar to its existing 8 factories. "Currently our\n', b'make/buy composition is around 70/30 and I have set a goal for the Company to\n', b'source around 50% of its products and components by the end of 1998," said Mr.\n', b'Dunlap.\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'<PAGE>\n', b'\n', b'\n', b'Mr. Dunlap added, "I have always believed that a merger or acquisition unleashes\n', b'a quantum leap in creating shareholder value, and I am very eager to make this\n', b'strategic move in the first half of 1998. We continue to work towards finalizing\n', b'our plans for merging with, or acquiring, one or more companies that will\n', b'provide added value to all shareholders. We also remain open to a sale of the\n', b'Company if that would produce greater value for our shareholders."\n', b'\n', b'Sunbeam Corporation is a leading consumer products company that designs,\n', b'manufactures and markets, nationally and internationally, a diverse portfolio of\n', b"brand name products. The Com pany's Sunbeam(R) and Oster(R) brands have been\n", b'household names for generations, both domesti cally and abroad, and the Company\n', b'is a market leader in many of its product categories.\n', b'\n', b'CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Statements contained in this press release, including\n', b"statements relating to the Company's expectations regarding anticipated\n", b'performance in the future, are all "forward looking statements" as such term is\n', b'defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
